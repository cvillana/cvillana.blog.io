					 <p class="article edited"> I am <b>Carl John D. Villana</b>. Presently residing at Dumaguete City. I am 20 years old. I am taking up <b><i>Bachelor of Science in Information Technology</i> </b>and I am now a third year student. I am currently studying at <b>Negros Oriental State University (NORSU)</b>, Dumaguete City. 
					</p>

					<p class="article">I decided to take up this course because when I was a child, I always admire my teacher and I always imagine myself that it was me who is teaching/handling the class. Also, it is my personal choice  and I told my parents that when I reach the college level, I will take the course of education. My family always support me in everything I do especially my mother.
